# Data Structure Algorithm in Python
This repository contains DSA labs and quizes in python.
This part of the repository contains my attempts od DSA in Python.
I haven't completed them right now.
So, they will surely change from time to time.
For now these codes are written  by me and thus there is a possibility there may be a mistake or two(as I am a human).
You can address them by telling them to me, by contacting me on my linkedinn or mail me. (if you want to!)
